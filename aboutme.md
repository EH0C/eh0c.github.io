Hi, Iâ€™m Edoardo, a Data Analyst specializing in ETL pipelines and Data Streaming. I hold a B.S. in Business Analytics and Information Systems from Suffolk University and have hands-on experience with Database Systems (MariaDB, Postgres) and Python (Pandas, PySpark, SQLAlchemy). I collaborate with engineers and analysts to transform raw data into insights, building dashboards with Metabase and Tableau.
